# 2.0 Number Systems

1. How do you write `2` in binary? `1`? `0`? `8`? `32`? `35`? `1000`? `65537`?
2. Use a row of LEDs to represent the number `5`. Use a row of LEDS to reprsent the number `26732`. (Hint: use binary!)
3. Make a logic circuit with 3 inputs and 1 output that is true only when the inputs is the binary representation of `5`.
4. Make a device with 4-bit input bus and 16 lights corresponding to the numbers `0`-`15` that display the input value. 
5. Make a 7-segment display for the numbers `0` through `7`.
    1. Follow-up: make a display for hexidecimal digits `0`-`F`.
6. Make a logic circuit with 16 inputs and 4 outputs, that encodes the input into binary.
