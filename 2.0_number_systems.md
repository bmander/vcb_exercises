# 2.0 Number Systems

1. How do you write `2` in binary? `1`? `0`? `8`? `32`? `35`? `1000`? `65537`?
2. Use a row of LEDs to represent the number `5`. Use a row of LEDS to reprsent the number `26732`. (Hint: use binary!)
3. Make a logic circuit with 3 inputs and 1 output that is true only when the inputs is the binary representation of `5`.
4. Design a device with a 4-bit input bus that can display the corresponding numerical value of the input (ranging from 0 to 15) using 16 indicator lights.
5. Make a 7-segment display for the numbers `0` through `7`.
    1. Follow-up: make a display for hexidecimal digits `0`-`F`.
6. Design a logic circuit with 16 input lines and 4 output lines that performs binary encoding, converting the activated input line into its corresponding 4-bit binary representation.
    1. Follow-up: make a keyboard that outputs the ASCII code of the button pressed.
7. Build a 4-to-16 decoder. (Hint: you've already done it.)
8. Build a 16-to-4 encoder. (Hint: you've already done that too.)
