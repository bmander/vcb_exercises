# 3.0 Addition and subtraction

1. Create a 2-bit adder circuit. It should have one line for each input, and two outputs - a result and a carry.
1. Modify the adder to accept a third 1-bit input. Why would you want a 3-bit adder?
1. Create a logical circuit that adds two 8-bit numbers together.
    1. Extra credit: create a 64-bit adder. What's the longest it can take to compute a result?
1. String together an encoder, an adder, and a decoder to make a 4-bit adding machine.
    1. Extra credit: show the result on a 7-segment display.
1. Create a logical circuit that takes a one's compliment of an 8-bit number when an 'enabled' line is activated.
1. Create a component that performs both addition and subtraction.
1. Modify your encoder-adder-decoder-display adding machine with a switch for subtraction.
