These exercises concern sequential logic - logical circuits whose outputs depend on not only the input, but the past output. Sequential circuits have _memory_. 

1. Make an oscillator out of a NOT gate. How does it compare to the built-in oscillator?
1. Build an RS flip-flop out logic gates.
1. Modify the RS flip-flop with the following features.
    1. An input calld "clock". When clock is low, both flip-flop inputs are disabled.
    1. Ensure that exactly one of the inputs of the flip-flop is high at any given time.
1. Build a level-triggered latch out of logic gates. It should have a "clock" and "data" input, and a Q and Q-bar output. The latch acts as one-bit memory, which saves the value at "data" whenever "clock" is high.
1. Build a level-triggered latch with exactly the same behavior using edge-triggered "latch" component built into Virtual Circuit Board.
1. Build an 8-bit latch.
    1. Optional: build a 64-bit latch.
1. Make an edge-triggered latch out of logic gates. It has the same inputs and outputs as a level-triggered latch, but only saves the "data" input when "clock" switches from low to high.
1. Make an edge-triggered latch with the same behavior out of the built-in VCB "latch" component.
3. Make an 8-bit accumulating adder. This circuit has two inputs - an input bus and clock line - and an output bus. Whenever the "clock" is switched from low to high, the input is added to the output.
