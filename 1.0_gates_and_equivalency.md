# 1.0 Gates and Equivalency

2. Make a buffer using just one gate type, for each gate: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XNOR`.
3. Make an AND gate out of OR and NOT gates, and make an OR gate out AND and NOT gates. (Hint: use De Morgan's Theorem).
4. Make every gate out of NAND gates.
5. There is one other gate type that can be used as a building block for all other gates. Which one? Use it to build every gate.
