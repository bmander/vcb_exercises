# 1.0 Gates and Equivalency

2. Make a buffer using just one gate type, for each gate: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XNOR`.
3. Make an `AND` gate out of `OR` and `NOT` gates, and make an `OR` gate out `AND` and `NOT` gates. (Hint: use De Morgan's Theorem).
4. Design a 2-input `XOR` gate using only `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates.
5. Make every gate out of `NAND` gates.
6. There is one other gate type that can be used as a building block for all other gates. Which one? Use it to build every gate.
7. Make an `AND` gate in the most absurd and convoluded way you can, out of as many component gates as you can stand.
